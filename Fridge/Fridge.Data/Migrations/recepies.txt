Place in the freezer for 10 minutes or until very cold, but not icing over. Cut the butter into very small pieces and place in the freezer, also for 10 minutes. Mix the flours in a bowl with a whisk if using both all-purpose and pastry flour. Spread the flour on a work surface to about ½-inch deep. Scatter the chilled butter cubes over the flour and toss lightly to coat them in the flour. Using a rolling pin, roll the butter into flat, thin pieces, still coated in flour. Using a bench scraper, scrape the flour and butter back together and roll out 2 or 3 more times.","Mound the flour and butter together and make a well in the center big enough to hold all the water comfortably. Pour in the chilled saltwater solution and use a bench scraper to cut the flour and water together, scooping and chopping, until you have a shaggy mass. Flour and butter should still be separately visible; do not work the dough enough to develop any gluten our the crust will be tough.","Roll out and scrape together the dough once or twice more, until it starts to cohere, but is still a bit crumbly. Split dough into two equal pieces of roughly 13 oz. each. Pile each portion in a rough ball onto a piece of plastic wrap. Wrap the dough into a ball and, in the plastic, work it again into a flat disk, roughly 1 inch thick. Chill dough for at least an hour, and up to overnight.","Make the filling: Tie the lemon peel, anise, canela or cinnamon, and vanilla husk into a piece of cheesecloth to make a spice satchel. In a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium-low heat, combine the quince cubes, sugar, vanilla seeds, lemon juice, and wine; stir until sugar is mostly dissolved.  Submerge the spice satchel in the quince mixture and raise heat to medium high. Bring mixture to a hard simmer, then reduce heat to a bare simmer, medium or medium-low. Simmer for 10 minutes, then cover and cook for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally until quince takes on rosy tones and most of the moisture is absorbed (the mixture should have a loose, jammy consistency). Remove from heat and allow to cool.","Pre-heat oven to 400°. Remove one piece of pie dough from the refrigerator and roll out to about ¼\". Drape the crust over the bottom and sides of a deep 9\" pie pan, lifting and dropping gently so it forms snugly to the pan without being stretched. Roll out the second piece of dough and cut shapes out with cookie cutters, keeping the cut pieces if you like. Chill the top crust on a sheet pan for a few minutes, so that the cutouts don\u0027t loose definition.","Spoon a thin layer of cooled, cooked quince in the bottom of the pie, and cover with an even layer of sliced pear. Alternate layers of quince and pear until the pie pan is close to full—you may have some quince and pear leftover; reserve those for another use.","Make the egg wash: Mix together the egg yolk and cream. Drape the top crust over the pie, and trim to 1 inch all around. Crimp or fold the two sheets of crust together around the edges. If you wish, use a small amount of egg wash to attach the cutout pieces of crust to the top of the pie decoratively. Generously brush the whole crust with the egg wash and sprinkle with raw sugar as desired.","Bake the pie for 15 minutes, or until crust just begins to brown.

{"Title":"Risotto Cacio e Pepe","Description":"Chef Massimo Bottura gave us the recipe for this creamy risotto, a take on the classic Roman pasta dish _cacio e pepe_ that he developed after earthquakes devastated the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy in 2012.

First, he simmers parmesan cheese in water, then refrigerates it until it separates into three distinct layers: protein solids on the bottom, a thick broth in the middle, and a parmesan cream on top. The broth is slowly stirred into the risotto, taking the place of chicken stock, while the cream is added toward the end of cooking, giving the risotto a luxurious texture and little need for any additional salt.","Ingredients":["2 lb.

A whole bird—you can use a Cornish game hen or a small chicken—is rubbed with garlic paste, cooked under a weight in an iron skillet, and served in a pool of butter with a side of niortskali, a sauce of pan drippings fortified with raw garlic and cilantro. This recipe first appeared in our November 2014 issue with the story The Glories of Garlic.","Ingredients":["1  (2-lb.) Cornish game hen, backbone removed","1 tsp.

Transfer hen to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before carving.","Pour pan juices into a bowl and keep warm. Add chopped garlic to skillet; cook until soft, 4–6 minutes.

Distribute about three-quarters of the chopped fruit over the batter in the pan, then top with the remaining batter.
